### Creating the news bar
Creating the news bar should be easy, should be as simple as attaching the menubar to the grid,
calling a data body from our server with a newsPost schema.

To create the news bar, we're going to need a new model, the 'newsPost' item, in server/models and handles in /controllers

We're also going to first need a location to create these posts, thus the admin menu needs to be created.

#### Creating the admin menu
To create the admin menu we will need to create a new HANDLER function called verifyIfAdmin, within user.js. After we update the controller, we create an axios routing and a client-side handler.
