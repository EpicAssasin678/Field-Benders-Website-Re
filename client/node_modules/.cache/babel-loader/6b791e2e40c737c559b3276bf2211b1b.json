Shortly after, the facility went supercritical, forcing the Japanese Government to \r\n                    shut down the area and evacuate en mass. Only a year after the explosion, those who tried to evacuate the estimated \r\n                    \"Fallout Area\" were afflicted with a horrifying new disease known only as The Sickness.
