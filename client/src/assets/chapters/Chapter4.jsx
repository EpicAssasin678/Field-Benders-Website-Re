Someone as new and promising as you shouldn&rsquo;t let such talent go to waste. &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Think I&rsquo;ve seen enough man, no need to unnecessarily go through that again. Plus there&rsquo;s those just as strong as me out there. You&rsquo;re no lightweight.&rdquo; Both of them looked downwards at the damaged concrete tiling.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So be it, I&rsquo;ll hold up my end of the bargain and report you MIA,&rdquo; he said while making it to the train before stopping abruptly. &ldquo;Listen, if you ever want to change your mind&hellip;there&rsquo;s always a spot for you in the 89th.&rdquo; The train began to pick up speed, whizzing compressed air and emitting an electric hum.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raiku cupped both his hands around his mouth and stood on his toes, &ldquo;Give the spot to someone else cause I won&rsquo;t be needing it!&rdquo; he shouted at the uncaring mass of metal chugging far away. Civilians waiting around him began to stare, perturbed by his volume. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in a while since he entered Honshu, he genuinely smiled, not out of sarcasm or jovial pursuits, but of satisfaction. Genuine excitement invigorated his walk the entire way back to Futaarayama Jinja.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towering before him, dominating its immediate surroundings, was the comfort of that rust brown Torii gate. A symbol to some as safety, of providence against the malevolent. Beyond the gate, standing impatiently amongst the innumerable stone steps was slender, brown-haired, women dressed in j&#333;s&#333;. She held her hand horizontally along her browline, squinting her eyes at the barely torchlit figure. Lightning struck, briefly lighting Raiku&rsquo;s shape and giving the Miko a window to identify him. Mere seconds after, a screech followed by clopping of wooden getas against wet stone became increasingly loud.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Raiku!&rdquo; she screamed, jumping up towards his chest, wrapping her legs around his torso and resting her head into his shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you chose to stay.&rdquo; she said, muffled by his skin. One of his arms supported her rear, and the other wrapped around her waist while he leaned his head into hers. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Me too Kanagawa&hellip;me too,&rdquo; he muttered, barely audible from the constriction within his vocal chords. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She retracted her head from his shoulder, pressing her forehead to his, &ldquo;So what did you tell ol&rsquo; Lorum?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh you know, something to the effect of &lsquo;I&rsquo;m never being a samurai again&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s going to go through with his deal?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad. I&rsquo;m so glad I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; she squeezed him even tighter, her rapidly beating heart reverberating against his chest. &ldquo;Actually&mdash;I do,&rdquo; she eased her grip, returning on her own two feet, &ldquo;dinner&rsquo;s ready at the quarters. Come on, everyone&rsquo;s going to be excited to see you, especially Sasami!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No complaints here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanagawa grabbed Raiku&rsquo;s hand, and began ascending the steps fastidiously until they were at the top. Such sudden stamina amazed Raiku until they arrived at the dark wooden gate and into the living quarters. Ofuda adorned the top edge of the exterior deck, waving erratically against the storm. Upon stepping foot along the deck, a small four foot figure violently opened the shoji. &ldquo;Kanagawa! And&mdash;wait&mdash;Surikaga-sama!&rdquo; said Sasami, charging forward onto the wet boards and hugging both of them, nesting her black hair between their bodies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Happy to see you too Sasami,&rdquo; uttered Raiku, constricted by the enormous compressive force a kid possessed at times.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Both of you, dinner is ready, come! They&rsquo;re waiting for you both,&rdquo; she exclaimed, dragging them both by their hands, giving Raiku only moments to remove his other foot covering. </span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After her victims were forcefully dragged into the mudroom, she released her grip, scampering down the hall and turning left into the dining area. Raiku and Kanagawa smiled at each other and began following the trail of wet footprints Sasami created while neglecting to remove her waterlogged socks. </span><span>The main hall was made of walls primarily composed of two halves; </span><span class="c2">one cherry wood plank coating and the other a traditional shoji. Traditional tatami covered the entire floor, springy and glossy as usual, its white hues somewhat juxtaposing the walls. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Kanagawa returned with a special guest for dinner!&quot; decreed Sasami, which was heard through the walls of the hall. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sasami! Take your socks off, they&#39;re soaked!&quot; ordered an unknown voice.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Little Sasami, who may that be?&quot; asked another voice, a little more elderly than the first.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sasami put out her hands, gesturing towards the open shoji like a magician waiting for smoke to burst and reveal a figure behind some cloth. Playful applause welcomed Raiku and Kanagawa immediately as they entered, which caused Sasami to bow victoriously. Cornered to the right of the room, patiently observing the steam rolling off a simmering pot, were a cluster of bustling Moki. Gathered around a long dark oak zataku in the center of the room, a group of monks watched the couple momentarily, pleasantly shocked at Raiku&#39;s presence. Most were dressed in joso, donning blue or black hakamas half-covered by kimono. These monks were mostly in their mid-twenties, some being children, and positioned at the head of the table was the only elder, Gojoro.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Welcome Surikaga-san. Everyone was hoping you&rsquo;d decide to stay with us,&rdquo; said Gojoro happily. Raiku glared at Kanagawa intimidatingly. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mad, she didn&rsquo;t tell me much, she was just venting that&rsquo;s all. Heard your scheming two nights ago. You can thank these walls, they&rsquo;re not exactly soundproof,&rdquo; he smiled. Everyone laughed while Raiku awkwardly scratched his head. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sasami-chan can you get another zaisu or zabuton for our guest?&rdquo; asked an older woman sitting next to Gojoro. Sasami nodded and rushed to the oshiire located in the left corner of the room. Fragrances of miso and bean sprouts circulated through Raiku&rsquo;s nostrils from air currents created from her sprint.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dinner&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; announced one of the Miko from the background. The group methodically carried the food onto the center of the zataku; two members carried the pot on each side, some carried a kyusu set containing macha, and others handled the plates of pork chops and bean sprouts and eggs. Children ran and grabbed rice eating mats from the oshiire while the women next to Gojoro distributed porcelain chopsticks. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Gojoro, it seems like you&rsquo;re going all out for this meal&hellip;you don&rsquo;t have to&mdash;,&rdquo; said Raiku in confusion as Sasami marched forwards to place a zaisu at the end. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well we figured either way we should have a feast for you, whether you left or not. To celebrate your defense of our home. Since you&rsquo;ve returned, we&rsquo;ll be feasting on the occasion of a new member in our ranks.&rdquo; Everyone else, including Kanagawa, assumed either a zabuton or a zaisu and waited for Raiku to follow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why thank you Gojoro.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well come on, don&rsquo;t make us starve!&rdquo; joked one of the monks, causing everyone to chuckle. Raiku sat down on the oak zaisu, putting one of his arms on the cherry wood laminate handle for support. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">Itadakimasu</span><span class="c2">,&rdquo; softly spoke Raiku, nodding and grabbing the bowl of miso from Sasami who was sitting next to him. Shiitake mushrooms floated above the brown oily broth, dispersing the chopped green onions and triggering saliva. He stared intently, inquisitively tapping and poking their caps with the blue dragon decorated on his chopsticks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Since when were shitake mushrooms back in the Anomaly?&rdquo; asked Raiku.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Since never Surikaga-san, Niamuru found a peddler in the market. Came from West they said, near Seoul or something like that,&rdquo; replied the monk next to Sasami. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Surprising market has peddlers still, would&rsquo;ve thought this city could produce enough of even the luxuries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well he traveled from Kita-Kanuma, so practically Utsunomiya.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Tochigi is still Tochigi,&rdquo; said Niamuru, shrugging her arms while shaking her head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;No Utsunomiya </span><span class="c4">is </span><span class="c2">Tochigi practically,&rdquo; asserted the monk next to Sasami.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Enough, enough,&rdquo; began Gojoro, &ldquo;so Surikaga-san, I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re here to stay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Correct. Oh! That is if you&rsquo;re offering,&rdquo; said Raiku.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; chuckled Gojoro, &ldquo;make sure to give our thanks to Catill-san if you would.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;ll see him again, he&rsquo;s with the 89th officially now. Been with them since he was 13, but before that they called him an apprentice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well invite him while you&rsquo;re at it! We can make shiitake miso soup for him again but even better this time!&rdquo; exclaimed Sasami, trying to contain her excitement. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raiku smirked slightly towards her, &ldquo;Promise I will, the 89th practically reports to Tokyo monthly, so we&rsquo;ll be a pit-stop for Lorum.&rdquo; He turned back towards Gojoro. &ldquo;That is if he doesn&rsquo;t miss me enough to make a special trip regardless.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; asked Kakkori to his right.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; said Raiku sarcastically.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell him someone else is already Raiku-struck and there ain&rsquo;t enough room for him too!&rdquo; yelled Sasami to Raiku. Kanagawa closed her eyes and smiled, nodding her rosy cheeks while everyone laughed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gojoro waited until the laughter faded. &ldquo;Speaking of Tokyo&hellip;another messenger came by while you were gone, Raiku. Edo requested Utsunomiya integrate yet again,&rdquo; he said while rummaging through his vestment for the holobook.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they understand &lsquo;no&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Raiku.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Afraid not,&rdquo; he replied while the holobook was being passed off.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What was the message this time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;See for yourself,&rdquo; he said, as Sasami handed Raiku the holobook.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two black carbon-fiber rectangular rods caressed his palms, they contained a bezel on each side, and a leveled expressed button on the ends. He pulled each portion apart, unrolling a glass-like film from a slit on the top rod. Once the film ran out, the material became rigid, blue electronic light instantly beaming down through the medium creating a screen. White kanji printed rapidly on the screen from right to left.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;With respect to the sovereignty of the Utsunomiya region and the authority Futaarayama Jinja has been given by the people amongst other shrines, we believe the enemies and threats this region may encounter has become greater than your group can handle as evident from recent events&hellip;,&rdquo; Raiku pushed the rods shut and looked over to Gojoro, &ldquo;why would they send this and not help in the first place? All they care about is geopolitics!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I agree unfortunately Surikaga-san,&rdquo; said Gojoro, sipping the remnants of miso broth at the bottom of his bowl. &ldquo;Now enough of this news, Niamuru, bring out the sake! We have a new addition to celebrate!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raindrops battered the brass door handle while Raiku and Kanagawa watched Sasami struggle to open it. Despite her zeal being entertaining to watch, the bitter cold rainstorm proved far too harsh and after a while Raiku inserted the key into the handle while looking at her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No fair, that&rsquo;s cruel, you should&rsquo;ve did that a while back!&rdquo; she complained, ineffectively punching his right arm while they walked inside. They all took off their ponchos and shoes into a pile near the doorway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Made two girls wait in the rain, you&rsquo;ll never attract someone like that,&rdquo; jeered Kanagwa while shaking her head. Raiku slightly glared towards her, making eye contact in his peripheral vision, and smiling. He tossed the key back towards her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Flanking them on all sides were clay walls divided into vertical sections by thin dark oak beams. Near where the wall met the floor, more dense oak strips created a molding to highlight the rather soft white tatami matting which showed some signs of age. Positioned high on both left and right walls of the room were small glass windows with manually closing blinds. Sasami danced the key in front of Raiku&rsquo;s distracted vision.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She pressed the key into his chest, appending it with her thumb, &ldquo;Gojoro-san told me this is yours,&rdquo; she said while looking down with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him my thanks,&rdquo; he said, inspecting the golden skeleton key.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sasami-chan,&rdquo; started Kanagawa, bending down to her level, &ldquo;could you leave us alone now and go back to the shrine, I&rsquo;m going to stay with Raiku-san tonight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For a moment, she displayed nothing but confusion, before connecting something in her head and widening her eyes. &ldquo;Ewww you two better not do anything bad&mdash;Ebisu&rsquo;s watching!&rdquo; said Sasami while scampering out the doorway, her getas clamoring as she ran down the road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gonna be fine?&rdquo; asked Raiku.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s not that far away, and her robes make her a target no one wants to hurt,&rdquo; explained Kanagawa behind Raiku. Nails softly descended around his neck, pressing further towards his chest, pulling herself flush against his back. Her chin rested upon the tens of branching polymer tubes trailing across his shoulder. Gentle, half-chapped lips plucked his neck while her hands backtracked to his upper arms. He turned around to face her and put his hands on her hips, ushering their waists closer. Gravitation pulled each of their heads close until their noses touched. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ebisu&rsquo;s watching,&rdquo; he whispered to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let him,&rdquo; she said, pressing her palms against the metallic breastplate where polymer tubes fed. She prodded the points of the junction with her nails, where each tube inserted into pressurized welling. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My Mk. IV,&rdquo; he replied, looking to her for a sense of direction before she softly exhaled. &ldquo;You can take it off by pressing this release underneath,&rdquo; he grabbed her hands, guiding her fingers underneath the plate, against a polished black depression, &ldquo;right here,&rdquo; he said, tapping an inlet button.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Electrodes connected throughout his body rescinded into his insulating layer with a hiss. Gas squelched and wheezed, the tubes and their partitions shrinking autonomously, lazily descending towards the floor. He kicked aside the jumbled mess of tubes while she pressed her nails against his insulating layer and the array of straps overtop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How about this?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Watch,&rdquo; he replied, guiding her hands to each point where the nylon straps met with metal belt clips. Starting at his chest, each clip required Raiku to assist her, the enormous resistance such a small piece had was more than one set of fingers could combat. The final clip around his waist detached, releasing his battery and saya which he caught before they plummeted into the tatami. &ldquo;This last layer isn&#39;t designed to get off easily, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good thing you won&rsquo;t need to put it on again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You have an alternative?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not right now, maybe I have some garbs the old man gave me.&rdquo; Her breathing gained pace. &ldquo;But for now&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped as he moved their hands to a zipper on his back.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he left her hands at his zipper and traversed down to her robe and the rope which kept it together, &ldquo;how about this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">That night was the last time Raku wore his original suit. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c10 c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c10 c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c10 c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c10 c4"></span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c10 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c10"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c10 c4">Chapter IV: Utsunomiya</span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c10 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Date: October 2nd, 2044, 16:00</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Location: Utsunomiya Station, Utsunomiya, Edo, Japan</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train ride was eerily silent, full of skittish corpses laying in contemplation, a callous graveyard forlorn in despair. Nothing spoken amongst samurai ever compared to what we witnessed, and yet we knew they could fight even better. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambient noise returned, filling the raither desolate soundscape with the incessant pounding of rain and the agonizing pangs of the distressed sky. Modesty was never the Anomaly&rsquo;s specialty. Some of these restless spirits around us watched as we dispersed from the train cabs and onto the platform. Utsunomiya Station had yet another open-design, with decayed rebar pillars creating an overhanging roof. Beyond these pillars, the city flaunted its form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stacks of concrete sectioned tenements resiliently towered over everything else, proudly displaying the scars of attrition. Dense fog unevenly covered the highest parts of these conglomerate structures, giving the illusion of infinitely tall proportions, ascending to the lightning. Lights from buildings and sky buoys bled into the vapor, diffusing upon the rather crowded streets. Such a spectral blanket caused the bustling masses to appear, at a distance, as wandering ghosts. A myriad of neon displays of illegibly small kanji and animated displays affixed to the sides of these narrow streets obfuscated any remaining distinction of their form. A poor man&#39;s purgatory, and a daunting mirage to explore from where I stood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Raiku shuffled his way to the front of our company and stopped, putting his hands on his hips and seemingly admiring that neon amalgam. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move,&rdquo; he growled into our comms. Compared to what lay far off in our vision, the immediate suburbs didn&rsquo;t resemble the same semblance of civilization. Low strung shadowy wanderers hovelled along the sidewalks, inspecting us up close when the occasional car or handcart slowly drove through. Every single lurking side eye felt like a specially tailored dagger to my conscious. That feeling became easier to tolerate as chatter amongst our ranks picked up to dilute my thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Terrified of some civilization?&rdquo; said Itadoske behind me, gripping my right shoulder out of nowhere with his muscular palm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; I replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright tough guy,&rdquo; he joked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We approached the belly of the beast, subsuming us into the labyrinth filled with meandering spirits and electrical fluorescence. A bright ocean of blues and oranges and fuschia reds and purples leaked into my vision and our forefront, like above us was another world, one of civilian houselife and noble gas. Motion picture displays using entirely a gaseous pixel-like display were also tacked onto the occasional wall eight stories above. Some projected news broadcasts from the outside world, of course, most being about the day behind; others showed train schedules, or propaganda from Edo, the mayor&rsquo;s voice occasionally booming over us. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Pretty different than Okuma right guys?&rdquo; asked Lorum, appearing almost out of nowhere. Ishin and Todo must&rsquo;ve begun walking alongside me as well a long time ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Too many people,&rdquo; commented Lorum, while reading a holobook, the text scanning across his display at hundreds of lines per minute. The white blur of movement reflected off the dull black paneling of his display.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t even come close to the small portion I saw in the 16th,&rdquo; said Itadoske. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Just wait until you see Tokyo,&rdquo; said Lorum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s even more crowded?&rdquo; asked Todo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Picture this, but more neon, more people, and more area.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Jesus, that sounds terrifying,&rdquo; remarked Todo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Insufferable is a better term,&rdquo; said Ishin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well there&rsquo;s nothing like home to some,&rdquo; said Lorum wishfully, probably squinting his eyes even though all we could see was his reminiscing smile.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Back in training you told us that you had been involved with the last four expeditions, so it can&rsquo;t be that much of a home.&rdquo; said Todo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well before the 17th I used to do missions within Tochigi and Edo basically monthly,&rdquo; he remarked.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorum chuckled, &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s classified for your rank.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh come on you can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; said Itadoske.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before we knew it, the density became less suffocating, the environment yet again returning to the rural pictures I had previously been acquainted with. Unlike that of Okuma, the smaller village areas on the south-side were less made of concrete and more of cherry plank. Mass amounts of high-standing trees and other vegetation obscured the houses in the distance. Replacing the city&rsquo;s tirade of foot traffic and technology to the ubiquitous bombardment of rain and the rare crowing of distant raven flocks made invisible by the storm. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miles deep into this rural area we reached a large Torii gate possibly 50 feet high, constructed of rust brown wood. Gold inscriptions were stamped into each pillar, reading roughly of some shinto legend I couldn&rsquo;t recognize. Half of the characters were made unreadable by corrosion regardless. Past the Torii gate were stone steps, what looked to be one hundred of them, ascending towards a gated entrance. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lorum walked in front of the group to Raiku, and nudged his shoulder. My attention focused towards their speech. &ldquo;How long has it been&hellip;since you walked through that Otorii?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Long enough,&rdquo; replied Raiku before beginning to walk up the stairs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Every forty or so steps, on each of our flanks, were small kamidanas in a row, each with a white spirit box attached by a long pole about waist height. Shide hung from their entrance with names of minor kami. </span></p><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Metal chimes sung to us on the last step, posted every foot along the walls of the entrance, shipping violently back and forth. The wall was rather traditional in its construction, bearing resemblance to old jinja in our archives. A cleanly masoned mortar base with dark wooden planking stretched for hundreds of feet, disappearing into the vegetation. Ribbed slats within a rectangular frame created a window effect from within the walls. What looked to be spotlights from towers which looked to be newly constructed into the walls shined on the head of our group.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raiku shielded his vision with his hand, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Surikaga-san of the first company. I believe we have a reserved </span><span>stay</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span class="c2">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torches posted an inch away and two feet apart from the wall and each other lit one after the other, spooking most of our group.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fancy,&rdquo; remarked Ishin, being one of the first to follow Raiku through the entrance. Before fully walking through the large archway, they halted and looked up to the exterior wall of the arch where ofuda hung an inch down. Raiku put out his hand back to the rest of us to stop moving forward.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seconds afterwards the ofuda detached from whatever invisible strands held them and slowly danced down to the slate brick path. The pair proceeded to walk by, Raiku&rsquo;s arm waving us forwards. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centered around a rectangular stone-paved common area were five buildings, two on our left and three to our right, the latter of which seemed to be delegated for lodging and celebratory activities. Extending into the court was the slate path, meeting at the center and circling the perimeter of a large cherry blossom tree before branching off towards our flanks, splitting the courtyard into fourths. Past the tree, nearly covered in my vision by its branches and figure was another inner entrance where a small set of stairs guarded by lion statues led into an unknown area. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posted on the bark of the tree was hundreds of ofuda with different wards inscribed into them. Small towers made of increasingly small stones laid around the soil of the tree, some supported by its root structure which crept into its already large perimeter. Around the masonry of the perimeter was granite walling raised 18 inches from the ground. Sitting hunched on that stone with her legs crossed over was a figure only inches shorter than myself, smoking and electronic syntherette. As she took a drag from the black cylindrical device, a blue aura of light shined in a ring at the bottom and illuminated eyes which stalked us between drenched clumps of black hair. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her head cocked upwards slowly as he got up from where she stood. Another drag. Distance made up for detail. Blue reflected off the hand she smoked with, wisps of vapor circulating between gray prosthetic fingers. The small cabled connections between and underneath metal plates slightly twitched. Torchlight showed off her white kimono which had a rose bud pattern embroidered around her lower waist and towards the right of her upper chest. Her black hakama was tied firmly, the wet nature of her clothing outlined what looked to be cybernetic foot structures. Another drag, this time bringing the arm which was used into the torch&rsquo;s light. Venous, muscle like synthetic fibers dotted with small form battery nodules which emitted a dying blue light, composed her arm. Prosthetic work I&rsquo;ve only seen in Sapporo. The vapor she released from her nose blew down into a red and gold omamori around her neck which had a lily pad pattern. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the smoke exhaled from her mouth was directed to Raikus face which was naked with his helmet disengaged. &ldquo;Sasami&mdash;&rdquo; he began before she slapped him in the face, &ldquo;I deserved that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not a single message? Not a single visit in six months?&rdquo; she said authoritatively. &ldquo;We needed you, you know that right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Been in Sapporo,&rdquo; he pulled himself to utter, looking away towards the ground.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorum walked up next to Raiku, &ldquo;Sasami baby&mdash;&rdquo; he began before she plugged his mouth with her syntherette. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And you, you didn&rsquo;t tell me he was actually going to come,&rdquo; she began. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a pull off the &lsquo;rette, creating more expression in Ishin&rsquo;s face than I thought was casually possible&mdash;that of disbelief. Smoke blew around the outline of Lorum&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d accept him,&rdquo; he remarked.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She scoffed, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t without an apology.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sasami-san, w-where&rsquo;s your sister?&rdquo; asked Raiku wistfully before turning to our right and looking towards the railing which surrounded what seemed to be the main living quarters. Barely standing, was a woman observantly peering at our group, her brown eyes welling up with tears while making contact with Raiku&rsquo;s. She shook her head nervously and walked inside the living quarters. &ldquo;Kanagawa&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c8 c11"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><div class="c12"><p class="c7"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a><span class="c2">Add mention of Sasami smoking electronic syntherettes and that Lorum last time they talked got him into it.</span></p></div><div class="c12"><p class="c7"><a href="#cmnt_ref2" id="cmnt2">[b]</a><span class="c2">Mention&nbsp; jokijo</span></p></div>
